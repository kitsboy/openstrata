# Deployment — OpenStrata / Hermes Strata

**Production:** https://openstrata.giveabit.io
**GitHub:** https://github.com/kitsboy/openstrata (branch: `main`)
**Hosting:** Cloudflare Pages (project: openstrata), static SvelteKit build via `@sveltejs/adapter-static`

## Deploy

```bash
npm ci
npm run audit:i18n    # translation + hard-coded-copy audit
npm run build         # writes static output to build/
git push origin main  # Cloudflare Pages auto-deploys from main
```

Deploys are triggered by pushes to `main`. The live site version marker
(`openstrata-version` meta) is verified after each release against the
`package.json` version.

## Verification checklist

1. `npm run check` reports 0 errors and 0 warnings
2. `npm run build` completes cleanly
3. `npm run audit:i18n` passes (0 missing keys, 0 hard-coded-copy warnings)
4. Live site serves the expected version marker after deploy

## Phase 3 backend (`backend/`)

The self-hosted backend stack is separate from the static Cloudflare site. It
runs on a Linux box behind Tailscale (per `hermes-strata-app-framework-v2.md`)
and is NOT deployed to Cloudflare Pages.

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env      # set a real password when they exist
npm install
npm run migrate           # apply ledger + pgvector migrations
npm run seed              # idempotent demo community (Cedar Point)
npm run dev               # Fastify API on 8080
```

Bring the stack up with Docker Compose (Postgres + pgvector + API):

```bash
cd backend
docker compose up -d
```

Backend verification: `npm run typecheck` and `npm test` (run from `backend/`),
plus the isolated `backend` job in CI.

See `SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md`, `backend/README.md`, and `docs/KIMI-HANDOFF.md` for
full context.
